      "Most digital marketing courses teach you how to set up an ad campaign inside a sandbox simulator or review slides from a deck that won an award three years ago. You pick targeting options, write a fictional headline for a fake sneaker brand, and receive a green checkmark.",
      "The problem is that simulators never teach you the gut punch of watching $500 of real money burn through a Meta Ads ad set with a 0.4x ROAS on day two. They don’t teach you what happens when your tracking pixel drops 40% of conversion events after an iOS security update, or when creative fatigue spikes your CPM by 180% in 48 hours.",
      "When you deploy real budgets on real brands with real products, your entire relationship with decision-making changes. You stop debating subjective aesthetics and start interrogating unit economics: What is our allowable CAC? Where in the funnel are users dropping off? Is our post-click experience fulfilling the promise made in the hook?",
      "At Treqo, we threw out theoretical mock assignments because top agencies and high-growth venture studios don't hire graduates who can describe what an ad manager looks like. They hire builders who have already weathered live volatility and can defend their attribution models with concrete spreadsheets.",
